    <h1>Alan T. Silva</h1>
    <p>
        A passionate traveler from Brazil who currently calls the USA home.<br> 
        An adventure seeker at heart, I love exploring new places and cultures,<br> 
        embracing every opportunity that comes my way. When I am not traveling,<br> 
        I am hitting the slopes, snowboarding through winter landscapes,<br> 
        or diving into the virtual worlds of my favorite video games.
