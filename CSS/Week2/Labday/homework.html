    <h1>List of Games Finished</h1>

    <p>I started finishing multiple games during the <strong>seventh generation</strong> of game consoles.<br>
        Some of them were for PC. I had a good intermediate PC that could play some heavy games for the time.<br>
        At that time, and even now, I have a tradition of putting a picture box in a folder on my desktop labeled "Finished Games."<br>
        Perhaps on the 7th generation, all my finished games were on my older <em>HP</em> laptop.<br> 
        I finished about 48 games on that generation, having a PS3 and an Xbox 360.<br>
        Here are some examples of games I finished at that time...
